## My Actions and Notes

* The project was developed from a starter packege provided on the assignment description page.
* Basic considerations were as follows:
    * Following packages were used: 
    * Application's folder structure follows MVC paradigm
    * Application was deployed to Heroku
    * I added features so that if the user is logged in, then he/she can delete his/her own comments from any post
